# -Large-Scale-Graph-Partitioning-with-Matlab

Project Overview

This project investigates the graph partitioning problem within the context of domain decomposition for high-performance computing (HPC) applications. 
Efficient partitioning of computational problems into sub-problems ensures load balancing and minimizes inter-process communication, which is crucial for parallel computing.

Objectives
Construct adjacency matrices from connectivity data.
Implement graph partitioning algorithms.
Recursively bisect meshes and compare results.
Compare recursive bisection to direct k-way partitioning.
Utilize graph eigenvectors for partitioning.
Evaluate partitioning results using METIS, a widely used graph partitioning software.




Methodology
Implement basic graph partitioning algorithms in MATLAB.
Interface MATLAB with METIS using metismex to leverage efficient partitioning.
Compare performance and partitioning quality across different methods.
Conduct numerical experiments on large-scale graphs to evaluate efficiency.
